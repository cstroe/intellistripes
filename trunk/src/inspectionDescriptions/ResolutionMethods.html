This inspection indicates incorrect work with methods returning Resolution.
Several cases can cause trigger of warning:
<ol>
    <li>Action bean class declares several Resolution methods without any @DefaultHandler annotation.
        (Tip: annotate one of method with @DefaultHandler)
    </li>
    <li>Action bean class declares several Resolution methods and few of them are annotated with @DefaultHandler.
        (Tip: remove one of @DefaultHandler)
    </li>
    <li>Action bean has one Resolution method and it's annotated with @DefaultHandler.
        (Tip: remove @DefaultHandler annotation)
    </li>
    <li>Action bean has several Resolution methods annotated with @HandlesEvent with the same value.
        (Tip: remove one of @HandlesEvent or rename value of annotation)
    </li>
