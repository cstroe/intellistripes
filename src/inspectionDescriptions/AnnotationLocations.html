This inspections indicated incorrect placement of Stripes annotations within action bean class.
Those cases are:

1. @SpringBean annotation is applied to public setter.
(Tip: rename method or make it private, or remove annotation to valid method)
2. @Validate annotation has field attribute, but is located outside of @ValidateNestedProperties.
(Tip: enclose annotation inside @ValidateNestedProperties or remove field attribute)
3. @Validate annotation hasn't field attribute and located within@ValidateNestedProperties.
(Tip: add field attribute to @ValidateNestedProperties)
4. @Validate, @ValidateNestedProperties, @ValidationMethod, @DefaultHandler, @HandlesEvent annotations are applied to invalid class member.
(Tip: remove annotations from member or annotate correct element according to Stripes docimentation)
