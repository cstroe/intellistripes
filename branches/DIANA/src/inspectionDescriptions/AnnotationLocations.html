This inspections indicated incorrect placement of Stripes annotations within action bean class.
Those cases are:
<ol>
    <li>@SpringBean annotation is applied to public setter.
        (Tip: rename method or make it private, or remove annotation to valid method)</li>
    <li>@Validate annotation has field attribute, but is located outside of @ValidateNestedProperties.
        (Tip: enclose annotation inside @ValidateNestedProperties or remove field attribute)</li>
    <li>@Validate annotation hasn't field attribute and located within@ValidateNestedProperties.
        (Tip: add field attribute to @ValidateNestedProperties)</li>
    <li>@Validate, @ValidateNestedProperties, @ValidationMethod, @DefaultHandler, @HandlesEvent annotations are applied
        to invalid class member.
        (Tip: remove annotations from member or annotate correct element according to Stripes documentation)</li>
</ol>
